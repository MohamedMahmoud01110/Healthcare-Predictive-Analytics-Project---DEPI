# DEBI-Project
# 🏥 Healthcare Predictive Analytics – Diabetes Prediction

This project aims to build a machine learning-powered web system to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals using medical and demographic data. By leveraging advanced algorithms such as Neural Networks, Random Forest, and SVM, the system provides early, accurate, and interpretable predictions for healthcare professionals and patients alike.

## 🔍 Project Goals
- Predict diabetes risk based on features like glucose level, BMI, age, insulin, and more.
- Deploy a scalable and secure ML model with real-time prediction capability.
- Empower clinicians with actionable insights to improve decision-making and patient outcomes.
  
## 📊 Key Features
- Cleaned and balanced a Kaggle dataset of 100,000+ patient records.
- Addressed missing data using KNN imputation and handled class imbalance with SMOTE.
- Explored data through EDA, identifying strong correlations (e.g., age and BMI).
- Achieved 97% accuracy with a Neural Network model.
- Implemented performance metrics (Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC).
